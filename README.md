# ECS279-Rigging-and-Animation
Basic function in unity:
#1. Key A,D for rotation; Key for walking. Space for jumping;
Basic model in blender:
I created creeper model with self-defined texture in blender. But when I import them into unity, it worked well at the beginning, but after I change the one action file accidently, somehow, there are something wrong happened that I even try to do it from scratch again a lot of times, it still does not fixed. So I use another model to finish animation part in unity.But all process I have gone thorugh.
