**Basic function in unity:**<br />
- Key A,D for rotation<br />
- Key W for walking<br />
- Key Space for jumping<br />

**Basic model in blender:**<br />
I created creeper model with self-defined texture in blender. But when I import them into unity, it worked well at the beginning, but after I change the one action file accidently, somehow, there are something wrong happened that I even try to do it from scratch again a lot of times, it still does not fixed. So I use another model to finish animation part in unity.But all process I have gone thorugh. 

**Demo shows the animation**<br />
